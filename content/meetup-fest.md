# NIDC {{< param year >}} Meetup Fest

From the 5th to 16th of September 2022, we'll be working with local meetups to bring you a flavour of the local tech community. As far as possible we'll also be aiming to stream them on our YouTube channel so you can tune in and ask questions even if you can't attend in person.

Meetups confirmed so far:

* Wednesday, September 7 - [Newry Digital - SRE and the rise of platform engineering](https://www.meetup.com/newry-digital/events/287655251/)
* Thursday, September 15 - [BelfAWSt Meetup - AWS Open Space](https://www.meetup.com/belfawst-meetup/events/287635152/)
