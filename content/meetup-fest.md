# Meetup Fest

NIDC was originally conceived as a "meetup of meetups", with attendees getting the chance to hear about what was going on outside their own tech bubble.

To help people connect with the local meetup scene and keep it vibrant, every year we run a Meetup Fest where you can choose from a smorgasbord of subjects. Why not go to a few and see what you can learn and who you can meet?
