# COVID

One of the reasons we selected ICC Belfast as our venue this year is its suitability for holding an in-person event while COVID-19 is still a factor, evidenced by the fact that they recently safely hosted a conference for 1,500 microbiologists.

## Capacity

ICC is a very large venue, with plenty of room on all floors for attendees to circulate while still maintaining a safe distance. 

## Ventilation

There is no recirculated air used within the ventilation systems - fresh air is supplied to all areas at a minimum rate of 10 litres per second per person. Toilets are provided with extract ventilation at the minimum rate of 10 air changes per hour.

Windows and doors are also opened where possible to provide additional natural ventilation.

## Hygiene

Hand sanitising facilities are available at key points throughout the venue, and an enhanced cleaning protocol is in place.
