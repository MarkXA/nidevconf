# COVID

NIDC {{< param year >}} will be a hybrid event, so some of the experience will be available online. However, for those keen to attend in person, one of the reasons we selected ICC Belfast as our venue is its suitability for holding an in-person event while COVID-19 is still a factor, evidenced by the fact that they recently safely hosted a conference for 1,500 microbiologists.

## Ventilation

There is no recirculated air used within the ventilation systems - fresh air is supplied to all areas at a minimum rate of 10 litres per second per person. Toilets are provided with extract ventilation at the minimum rate of 10 air changes per hour.

Windows and doors are also opened where possible to provide additional natural ventilation.

## Hygiene

Hand sanitising facilities are available at key points throughout the venue, and an enhanced cleaning protocol is in place.

## Distancing

ICC is a large venue, with plenty of room across all floors for attendees to circulate while retaining the option to keep a reasonable distance.

## Tests

We strongly encourage you to take a lateral flow test before attending. Please do not attend if you have COVID-19 symptoms, or if you have tested positive for COVID-19 - your ticket will be refunded in this eventuality.

## Hybrid

For those who still are not confident attending an in-person event, we will be streaming talks online on the day.

## More information

We will follow all government guidance in place at the time, so please check for any updated information before your visit.
