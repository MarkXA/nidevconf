In this talk we will chronicle our journey into micro-services architecture and event sourcing, and how we took these design principles to push our development throughput to the limit at the “Good (A)idea hackathon” held in NI in April, 2019. We will also show-case our idea; “Bringing content curation into the hands of social media platform users”, the implementation of which incorporates real-time streaming analytics using Apache Kafka, along with multiple continuously retrained machine learning models to stimulate discussions around the designs used, as well as some of the difficulties we encountered.
