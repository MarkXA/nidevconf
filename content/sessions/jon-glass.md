In search of the best of both worlds in automated testing: Although the value of automated testing is almost universally accepted, teams that shoot for good coverage often end up with a mixture of cumbersome, mock-heavy unit test fixtures and long-running monolithic automation test suites. In-Memory Integration Testing is about finding ways to test an entire service, running exactly as it would in the wild, but before it has even been deployed. By testing in a CI build using unit test runners, but exercising the whole application, we can shift left for earlier feedback and more confidence of continuously deploying software that works.
