Data is at the core of the things we do as developers. This talk goes back to the start, what data is and how we can use it for business benefit. 

I'll cover how customer loyalty data is created and then used. How Tinder originally used a formula to create matches based on chess player ranking. And what happens when vendors and startups cross the creepy line and use the data against us. 

What's the long term value of a customer using a cardboard loyalty card? We can figure that out. I'll show you how. Then also talk about where data, ethics and the use is heading.

This is a high level talk, so no programming experience is required.
