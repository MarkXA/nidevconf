Observability is key to ensuring your system is performing as intended for users. In this talk we’ll take a look at understanding what Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are, defining some example SLOs and then a demo of how to implement the tracking of those metrics and configuring some alarms to fire when they’re at risk.

This demo will include some Golang, AWS and Prometheus. Maybe a sprinkle of chaos engineering.
