In this talk we will examine the ever growing value of metadata, observability and data cataloging in delivering data solutions that are more trustworthy and understandable. 

We will follow the Insider data teamâ€™s journey with DataHub - the open source metadata platform. 

From expert advice on evaluating products in a competitive and evolving market and harnessing user research to inform decisions through to the process of building and populating a data catalog from the ground up using a modern data engineering workflow.

Attendees will learn about the capabilities of the DataHub platform and the benefits which it unlocks, creating an environment where data is trusted, accurate and accessible, resulting in new data products which are more likely to be adopted by analyst teams
