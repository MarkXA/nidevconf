AI Engineer, ML Engineer, Data Scientist, NLP & Vision Engineers. We have entered a tipping point of Artificial Intelligence role specialism. This is not a new pattern, the AI technology sphere is repeating history and following a well-worn path. A path taken by Java, JS and several others during their own surge of popularity and subsequent maturation, spawning specialists in technologies such as Spring and Angular JS. In this talk Jordan will address this evolution through the lens of AI and make the case for why your organization should aim to build your AI teams with a horizontally skewed skillset, defying the lure of specialism.
