The session will provide some introductory information about the use of machine learning for processing biosignals produced by the human body (and some practical code examples of how someone can get started). 

The talk will also provide a brief direction for where AI can play a role in medical applications and provide some examples as well as give a brief intro to Axonnr and how we are using AI to progress robotic prosthetic technology.
