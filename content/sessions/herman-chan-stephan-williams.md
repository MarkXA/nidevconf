We are one of the oldest esports teams in gaming, and we have a secret weapon that gives us an edge over our competitors: a full software engineering, data science and product team. But what are those engineers and data scientists actually working on?

We’re going to talk a little bit about our current tech & data initiatives, how we helped our League of Legends team win the teams first ever championship, the products that we’re creating in the space, and the challenges we’ve faced along the way. 

Come and join us if you’re interested to hear about the future of technology in esports, and how we think it can explode in the coming years.
