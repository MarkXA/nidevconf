We want engineers who ask questions, help each other out, and pitch in.  We want close collaboration with a product owner, and communication across teams so that an entire company strives together to accomplish great things. 

We also know that engineers need focused time free from distractions to be productive. In a world of constant distraction, what is the right balance and how do we find it?
