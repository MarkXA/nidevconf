A talk about a project that pulled together a multidisciplinary team of people from different businesses and sectors to produce tools for the open industry.

What is Open Development? There is no hard and fast definition but one of the best ways to try and answer this question is to look at some of the general principles in the context of a real world project. The project was initiated to create tools to help people in the open data industry; it used open source software and the project team was about as open as it gets.

So, how did it come about? What were the processes used? What was the outcome? and was the project successful? These are all things we will see at as we look at this in more detail.
