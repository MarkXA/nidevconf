In this presentation we’ll review the current state of quantum computing, lease a quantum computer in the cloud, and write our first quantum computing program.

Along the way we’ll delve into the physics behind quantum computing and discuss the different approaches to quantum computing the big players are taking. 

We'll also consider what "quantum supremacy" means, and the kinds of problems quantum computing will be able to help us solve.

Finally, I'll share my recommendations of how you can get started with quantum computing.
