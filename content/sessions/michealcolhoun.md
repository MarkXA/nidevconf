After 20 years of working as a Software Developer I share my journey to becoming a startup Co-Founder of a Business that relies heavily on Technology. Sounds like it should be easy however the greatest challenges were not Technology but rather what technologies to avoid including my own Software Solutions. This talk is a raw and opinionated view into the evolution (or Otherwise?) of running a real technology focussed business.
