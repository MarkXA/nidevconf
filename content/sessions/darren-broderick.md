Using a sequential model from the Keras API.

Looking at 2 examples, the first being a small example file dealing with the basics of a flat model and a prediction made from a 1 layer input after it has been trained.

The second being a demo of a rock-paper-scissors game that takes 4 input labels to train a model for an ai to decide on a winning move based on your hand gesture image.
