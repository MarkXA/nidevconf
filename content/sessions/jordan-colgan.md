In this talk we will present the idea that simple and hard make effective results.

First, we will prove that simple and hard equals effective by telling an all too familiar story of when something complicated and hard resulted in not very effective results. From this, we will use logic and reasoning to reverse the formula of complicated and hard being the least effective into one of simple and hard being the most effective.

Expanding further, we will discuss simple over smart, why being smart and creating complexity doesn’t help you and others. We will also explain why we must do hard things to get better (because it ain’t ever going to be easy).

After providing enough context on why we say simple, hard, effective, we will now begin to tie in how this phrase is incredibly valuable when discussing software and crafting good software.

There will be three examples of practices in software craftsmanship and engineering that are simple, hard to be good at, but deliver immensely effective results. These will be practices that are so simple, you can start applying them straight away to your work.

The key take-aways of this talk will be:
- Learning how simple is good and being “smart” is actually not great
- Coming to terms that we will have to work hard, it’s just nature
- Familiarity of practices not commonly used in the software community and industry within Belfast, but will set you apart if mastered
- Being able to convince others that we should apply the practices learnt, because simple and hard make effective results
