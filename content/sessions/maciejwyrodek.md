Testers are annoying, those pesky little beasts that find issues in your perfect code. What a nightmare.

They waste time testing stuff that is covered by unit tests. They waste time testing stuff that is not important! And yet somehow they do find bugs by a lucky guess.

And yes paragraph above is extreme hyperbole. But the truth there is often divided between developers and testers. Let's look at one of the ways of fixing this divide. Letting them write some code, even production code! 

I know it sounds crazy, but this works. It makes them understand developers much more. Their pride and frustration. 
So join me and take a look what Dev can do to break the wall.
