Are you a developer who’s never explored Augmented Reality? Scared of game engines? Just wanna impress your mates during lockdown? Join me on a journey to create your first AR mobile app in just 1 week!

AR is one of the biggest technology trends right now, and it’s only going to get bigger as AR-ready smartphones become more globally accessible. It can be used to solve real-world problems by merging the real and digital world, via a digital overlay of graphics and interactive features.

You may think AR is only used in Snapchat filters - Valuable solutions can be seen across many industries such as Healthcare, Manufacturing, Education, Tourism and Retail. For example, IKEA's Place app uses AR to let customers see how their furniture could look and fit into their own homes.

In this talk, you’ll learn the brief theory behind AR, how you can setup a base project in Unity and further technologies to get you started - Giving you the core knowledge needed to let your immersive imagination run free!
