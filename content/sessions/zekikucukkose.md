The talk will cover:

- What open banking is
- Why it is needed
- How the UK is implementing it 
- How it will build an ecosystem for developers to enter the fintech space. 

After explaining the concepts behind open banking, I will run through the open banking APIs that exist in the UK and how developers can get involved. The overall aim of the talk is to encourage people to get involved in fintech and help them learn how they can start up their own side project using this new technology.
