There is a misguided conception that we all need to be rocket scientists to use machine learning in production - to this I say balderdash!  ... Machine learning is an engineering skill that developers need to add to their bag of tricks, and the journey doesn't have to be painful. 

The aim of this session is to give a solid crash-course in "just enough" Machine Learning that attendees can apply the skills learned in a practical manner, in code, immediately.

So, leave your calculus and trigonometry at the door, and learn how to predict the future in 45 minutes, no math required :)
