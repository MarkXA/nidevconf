Blender is one of the most substantial open source projects going. Not just free but feature packed. This talk will be an overview of the core features (modelling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking, video editing), plugins and the future of Blender.

It has come a long way since it was first open sourced, giving the costly competitors an honest run for their money.

Blender is in the process of getting its biggest overhaul in nearly 10 years, which the talk will also cover. It recently completed a successful funding campaign raising over $100K to fly all the core developers from around the world to meet up for several months in order to work on a massive code refactor, implement long gestating new features and spring clean the UI.
