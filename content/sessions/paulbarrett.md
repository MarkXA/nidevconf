This talk will be an overview of the Godot game engine - an impressive open source alternative to Unity that is starting to gain a lot of momentum. It has dedicated 2D and 3D engines that can build to major platforms (desktop, mobile, web and VR). With its rich UI, Godot has in-built editors for coding, visual scripting, shaders, 3D animation blend nodes, tile-maps, 2D skeletons and more. Coding is done primarily in Python-like GDScript but Godot also supports C# and C++. Unlike Unity, Godot does not require registration to use and anything you make with it is 100% yours to own.
