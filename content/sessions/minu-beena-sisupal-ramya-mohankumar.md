When in a project, we have a requirement to find matches of two columns and exact joins are not doing well, then we have to use less exact match using fuzzy matches logic. Through this session, I am going to introduce few techniques like cosine similarity, Levenshtein distance etc. There will a brief discussion on SQL Joins followed by introduction to fuzzy matches.
