The tech industry is undergoing a change not seen since the turn of the century - tech companies of all kinds are laying people off, hiring freezes are more frequent, the era of blitzscaling is over, and it's becoming harder for startups to raise funding. All of this against a backdrop of economic uncertainty. However, in the words of Douglas Adams, don't panic.
