There is a gap when it comes to matching music metadata specially in the face of Youtube and FaceBook where anyone can upload their videos. The use of music needs to be identified and the artists and publishers need to be paid the royalty for their creative works. We are working on a Project to map and match the various music identifiers and come up with a futuristic guidelines /identifier for tracking music metadat across web, AR/VR. This research is undertaken in collaboration with IPO(Intellectual Property Office) and PRS/PPL who are major stakeholders.
