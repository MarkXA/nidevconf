Go is a programming language that was developed inside Google in 2007. The language is now 12 years old and is seeing increased adoption each year. Go is a strongly typed language, all variables are known or inferred at compile time, and was developed for the 21st century with a focus on simplicity and readability. It has a well-designed concurrency model and a modern network stack, which makes it a good language for network-based services. This presentation will take a deep dive into the machine code produced by the Go compiler and see how it stacks up against traditional C/C++ compilers. Additionally, this talk will cover how the Go-types are tracked by the runtime, including interfaces.
