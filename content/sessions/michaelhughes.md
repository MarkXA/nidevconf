A show and tell of how we went from concept to having a delivery pipeline that releases into our QA environment automatically and safely. I’ll talk through the decisions and tools used getting to where we are right now, how we gate our releases and use unopinionated versioning to our advantage. I’ll also talk about how we progress and get to production.
