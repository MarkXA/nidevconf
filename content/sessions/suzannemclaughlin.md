Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland (OSNI) have lots and lots of cool locational data from aerial photography, maps of all scales, addresses, and elevation data. All of this data is available free to developers in order to encourage you to get creative with the data. Only when (and if) you start to make a commercial product from which you derive an income will you have to return any royalties to OSNI. You will be very surprised at how little of your hard earned cash you will have to pay back! So come along and find out how you can get involved and get your hands on some mapping data.
