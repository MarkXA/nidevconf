Stories from the coalface of development with Xamarin. From conception through to release, a walk through our adventures in overhauling our mobile client architecture at TheAppBuilder. Along the way we will look at strategies for mobile client development, why we chose Xamarin and when you might too, and the what and why of the Xamarin technologies on offer.

We'll take a dive into our technical architecture, and explore how to go from development to production and keep a finger on the pulse of your live applications, not forgetting testing, training, and building a multi-skilled team. Keep an ear out for some insider tips on optimising performance, maximising code reuse, and ensuring your UX is in tip-top shape!
