I propose a new session type - a guided conversation: 

A GuidedConversation is a meeting where a facilitator comes up with a starting set of questions around a single topic. The group then discuss those questions with 8 minutes given for each question.

During GuidedConversations you introduce the current question and listen for off-topic items. If you think that an off-topic item sounds like something worth discussing, you add it to the list of scheduled questions. Usually it is one of the questions you already have in your deck of cards.

I would like to run a session about graduate/junior developers. Sample questions include: 

How do you define a junior dev
What can you learn from juniors 
How and when do we ask for help?
What can we do to build up experience outside of work and how important is it that we do?
When are we not junior developers?
What are the hardest things about developing an early-stage career?
Big cooperate company vs small, start-up company - how do we decide which would be best for us to join?

The session would be for 20 people ( sat in a circle) and if possible last an hour?
