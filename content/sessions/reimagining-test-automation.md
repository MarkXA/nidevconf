Releases can often be stressful and time-consuming for everyone involved. Looking to improve this, our goal was to streamline our deployment process, including getting quicker feedback from our automated tests. We identified pain points and found a number of solutions that included migrating our build and test pipelines from Bamboo/Jenkins to Azure Pipelines, and using In-Memory testing to address limitations in UI testing. We will take you through the process we followed to achieve this and the benefits it has made to ESO.
