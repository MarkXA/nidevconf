Is it possible to design an algorithm that will decide what to do with a poker hand in under 30 minutes? In this session I'll attempt to do so, breaking down the problem in small functions and showing you how it translates to code.

This talk is for everyone regardless of experience: coders, project managers and anyone interested in solving problems. It also gives us a glimpse into incomplete information scenarios which form the basis to machine learning and artificial intelligence. How do we decide when we don't have all the information?
