This technical session will cover 'the what', 'the why' and 'the how' of getting your data into the cloud - and taking a good old look at it! We'll look at a sample dataset and go through setting up a data pipeline and monitoring stack in a fun and friendly way using Logstash, AWS, Elasticsearch, Elastic Agent, Elastic Cloud and Kibana - with some added Python to top it all off! 

We'll also see just how easy it is to set up security observability on your Elastic Cloud cluster once your data is ingested, helping to protect the world's data from attack one datastore at a time!
