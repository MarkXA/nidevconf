Everyone is doing Agile, right? I mean, it's just the standard way of doing things now? But is it really? For many, it's just stand-ups and sprints, and nothing else has changed. In fact, it's probably worse, because Agile promises to be so much, and when it's not done properly, leaves real disappointment and resentment; it feels like the Emperor's new clothes. It just doesn't feel very SAFe.

Modern Agile attempts to address this by putting safety at the core of its being: the safety to experiment, the safety to fail, the safety to learn. This is more important for building awesome products, services and solutions than anything else, and unlocks true potential.

I'm going to talk about management theory, about motivation, about safety, and about how Modern Agile principles should be at the core of doing things well.
