Deploying Serverless-First, Well-Architected applications to AWS is hard! Especially hard if you are new to the cloud, you could have dozens of ways to solve the same problem.

Let me tell you about how over the past 10 years we have created the environment for developers to be in production with new pieces of AWS to them in minutes if they so choose. We have created a catalogue of golden path patterns, each assessed against AWS Well-Architected and only one click away from deployment. This journey also doesn't end at deployment, that is just the first step. I will tell you how we drive the day two developer experience by providing real time information and telemetry on applications advising how well architected they are or where they can be improved.

We have used this process globally to the extent that we now have over 85,000 AWS Lambda functions in production. Our patterns have been used thousands of times but most importantly hundreds of developers have contributed back creating a flywheel of inner source and innovation.
