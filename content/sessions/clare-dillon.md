InnerSource, or the use of open source methods inside a firewall, is emerging as the best way to facilitate collaborative development within large corporate organizations. It breaks down silos and enables distributed teams to innovate faster. It appeared on the latest Gartner Hype cycle for the first time in 2022 as an emerging practice globally. It also has proven to be a great step on the path to open source readiness for organizations who wish to begin working in the open. In this session, we will be joined by Clare Dillon, Executive Director of InnerSource Commons, the world's largest community of InnerSource practitioners. Clare will give an introduction to the practice of InnerSource and share some of the latest trends on where and how it is being used.
