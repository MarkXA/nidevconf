This talk will be about my experience as a total newbie to Typescript, the Ionic framework and Laravel, for writing a mobile application and website for Culture Night. It will also cover my motivations for writing the app, learning several new languages and frameworks at the same time, and my takeaways from my experience. The talk will also concern how app development could be used for local events in Northern Ireland for helping with visitor satisfaction and organisation.
