As frontend developers, typically when we build sites and apps, the user we are concerned with is the end user, looking at our product in their web browser or via an app. But what if this isn’t the case?

When building a component library, as well as considering end users, we must now also consider the needs and the experience of other developers, those who will be using our components in their own development work.

What effect does this have on how we work as creators? How do we ensure a good user experience for both developers and end users? Where do design, product and other teams fit into this flow?

We’ll look at these questions and more along with some potential answers and real world examples.
