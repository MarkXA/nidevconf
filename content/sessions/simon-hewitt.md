Efteling is a European theme park in Holland originally opened in 1952, inhabited by roller coasters, fairytale creatures, medieval knights and a mysterious court jester. The question - is it possible to visit every attraction in a single day, or do we need to book a second?  

This practical implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem, a classic Computer Science problem, will demonstrate different methods of calculating the time required to visit every single attraction at the Efteling theme park. Or is this question just too big for one computer to handle?
