Did you know there’s one inside your browser?

With just a few lines of JavaScript and a little bit of experimentation, we can turn our browser into our own bespoke, one-of-a-kind instrument - no extra hardware or plugins needed.

Join me for a beginner-friendly, retro-tinted journey into creative Web Audio in the browser. We’ll tweak some virtual knobs, make some weird sounds, get a beat going, and throw it all together. Help me bring the noise-pop stylings of my formative years full circle, and learn about creative browser APIs, JavaScript data structures, and web audio in the process!
