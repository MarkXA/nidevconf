How does technology support large enterprises? Typically these businesses have multiple applications serving many different purposes, including customer management, order management, billing, HR, and payroll.

Imagine this scenario: You receive an order from a new customer, they have to be added to the customer management system, the order has to be added to the order management system with the customer ID, and an invoice has to be produced in the billing system with the order number and customer ID. In essence, multiple applications need to be integrated to enable data flow.

However, what happens if one of these systems is out of support or needs to be replaced? Re-building the integrations from scratch with a new application will be costly and time consuming.

Hear how middleware integrations can help connect these enterprise applications in a more innovative way.

There will be a live demo using a leading Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) solution so you can see it in action!
