"Devsecops" is one of the big buzzwords in the modern information security world, but what exactly does it mean? In this lightning talk I cover how "traditional" security practices break down in the face of modern Agile development practices, and how developers can manage to create secure code while maintaining speed to market.

Among the topics discussed are security education for developers, using red-teaming to drive security awareness, automated security testing (in its various different forms) and proactive security monitoring of applications.
