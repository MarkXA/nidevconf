Software development is inherently complex in nature. For such complex problems there are no recipes for success that can be followed.

US Marines rely on heuristics when the original battle plan breaks down, such as “capture the high ground, stay in touch and keep moving”. Can we use a similar set of heuristics in our Agile deliveries?

A heuristic is anything that provides a plausible aid or direction in the solution of a problem. They can produce accurate decisions by exploiting the structures of information in the environments they are applied.

Join me to explore how underpinned by Agile principles and practices we can create a set of heuristics that can be used to create a delivery foundation.
