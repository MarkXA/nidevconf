‘When will it be done?’ is one of the first questions that you will be asked when you engage in building a software solution. If you are like most of us you will get it wrong more often than you will get it right and you are going to spend a lot of time in the process. What about if there is an alternative and you can provide a more accurate answer without even estimating? This talk offers an answer by implementing a #NoEstimate approach built on an Agile delivery process based on a ‘measurement and observation’ philosophy where trusted forecasts are a reality.
