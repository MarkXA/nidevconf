This talk will discuss the intersection of tech, politics, and progress. Specifically, it will highlight a few brief fascinating case studies, such as how supposedly blind algorithms can enforce human prejudices and how digital photography is influenced by current beauty standards, and then go about highlighting some potential solutions or mitigating tactics for those of us involved in making such tech. And yes, probably something about Brexit and the recent US presidential election.
