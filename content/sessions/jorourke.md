You've spent months developing something; you've researched, coded, pulled all-nighters and generally lived and breathed your project. 

Next step: getting people to actually use it. 

Whether you're trying to get people to download it, click on it, read about it or buy it, it's easy to fall into the features trap.

You'll know you're in the features trap if people's eyes glaze over when you start talking about your project.

Non-techie people don't really care about the cool features (mostly because they don't know what they mean.)

They just want to know what it does for them. 

Does it make their life easier?

Save them time?

Make them money?

Stop them feeling bad?

This is the value of your product. That's what you need to communicate.
