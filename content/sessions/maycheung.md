Developers probably regard software licences as the dull part of the install, but they form a key part of the infrastructure that underpins Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).  Licences allow and protect the use of FOSS worldwide and in this talk May will provide a quick guide to the basics of FOSS licences.

This will include pointers on what common licences allow so that one does not just do the ethical thing, but also remains on the right side of the law, whether integrating FOSS as a developer or running it as an end user.
