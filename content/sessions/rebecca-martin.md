Over lockdown, I re-explored old games that I had played in the past, one of them being League of Legends. One thing that interested me in particular is people using automated scripts or bots to play the game for them, often times to get the account to the lowest rank possible, and sell those accounts on for a substantial amount of money. This behaviour ruins the game experience for the rest of the players in the team, and so faced with this problem I aim to present a potential solution, using Python and machine learning libraries. As this is my first proper experience using machine learning in Python, I hope to share my insights on what I have learnt from my personal project and what you can take away from my experiences.
