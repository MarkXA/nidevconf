Do you want to learn assembly, but thought the conventional methods were too mainstream for you? Do you also have a healthy amount of self-loathing? If that sounds like you, I have the talk for you! First things first, we'll have a brief discussion on the history of emulation and why it's so important to emulate what is often seen as obsolete software for preservation purposes. After that, I'll show off a personal project I have going on - writing my first emulator in Go for the Game Boy! We'll discover how to write your very first emulator and hopefully get a game running.  Even if we don't get a game running, you'll take away how the bare bones and fundamentals of programming work with the Game Boy variant of Z80 ASM, and have a bit of fun along the way.
