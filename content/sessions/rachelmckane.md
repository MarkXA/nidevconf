A brief history of how GIS as a discipline and then a technology came into being. This will include an overview of Esri Inc and Esri Ireland, including the type of jobs available here on the island. I will also talk about the ArcGIS Developer Program and demonstrate how easy it is to add data to a map and then how to embed the created map into an HTML web page. I will show how quickly an app can be created and shared.
