Secrets management is a discipline becoming increasingly popular in enterprise applications and infrastructure. Done correctly, it can increase the security and agility of engineering teams. Done incorrectly, and it can result in increased complexity, poor security and inefficient development and operations. Using Hashicorp Vault as an example, this talk will describe the design and implementation of a secrets management platform for a large digital transformation project. The audience will come away with an appreciation of what secrets management is, how tools like Hashicorp Vault can be used to build such a platform, and an understanding of the best practices around it.
