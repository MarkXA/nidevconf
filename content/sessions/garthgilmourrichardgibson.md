Last year Garth presented on the basic concepts of Functional Programming, using Kotlin and the Arrow framework. This year he will be partnering with Richard Gibson to kick the discussion up a notch and explain the benefits of fully embracing FP. This talk will cover how and why you might wish to code in the Pure FP style, and walk you through the whole bestiary of scary sounding terminology. So if you've ever wondered what is meant by Typeclasses, Algebraic Types, Higher Kinded Types, Free Monads, Tagless Final and Effects then this is the talk for you.
