Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper in 2009 titled, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". Since then, cryptocurrencies have an estimated market value of $425 billion (as of time of writing). 

Most people who are aware of crypto have typically heard of the two "B's" - Bitcoin and Blockchain. The former, created in 2009, is a type of digital currency and was the first ever decentralised cryptocurrency. It has been coined the digital gold of the 21st century, and it's popularity lead to the creation of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies which are commonly known as alt-coins (alternative coins). At the heart of Bitcoin and many of these alt-coins, they employ a technology known as a Blockchain. Being one of the core features of a cryptocurrency, it took me a while to truly grasp what it was and what role it played in a functioning cryptocurrency.

In the 30 minutes provided I hope to demystify what a Blockchain is and break down the core features of a Blockchain by walking the audience through one created in JavaScript (being a JavaScript enthusiast and all..).
