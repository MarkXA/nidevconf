Cloud hosting, cloud storage, and the resulting data exposure, none of this is new. We’ve been overwhelmed over the past year or so with the volume of press and opinion on the impact of open S3 buckets in particular with reference to the exposure of data from the RNC, Accenture and Verizon.

The question is whether this has had an impact on how data is stored in cloud environments and whether we have learned anything.

This talk will hope to provide a level of understanding about the use of insecure cloud storage facilities with a focus on a particular technology under extensive use. We will present our findings on the amount of data exposed, why and how it was exposed and a case study of how to identify the owners of the data to promote responsible disclosure.
