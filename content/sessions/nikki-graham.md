The UK tech industry has up to five times more incidences of poor mental health amongst its staff than the UK average.  This session explores why this could be, what the hotfix is, and who exactly should be on the solution development team.

We are more than just a human interface and normal operation is not a simple concept.  Each and every one of us has our part to play in the user flow of debugging this issue.

It is not a quick fix.  It is not an easy fix.  It is, however, an issue which needs to be brought to the forefront so that our staff are empowered with the toolkit to help themselves and others before this epidemic gets out of control.

If we do this, then everyone is a winner.  Well staff, mean well organisations.

This is our call to action.
