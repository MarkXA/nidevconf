Empathy is a Super Power!

It’s a key ingredient in the development of products that people love, and in the creation of high performing teams. It is cited as one of the core future skills for work by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) in it's ‘Skills for 2030’ report.

However empathy is also a skill the world is critically lacking in at the moment. Barack Obama has referred to this as an ‘Empathy Deficit’ - and called it ‘more important than the federal budget deficit’.

So - what exactly *is* empathy, and more importantly, how can we become more empathetic?

This talk will cover the definition of empathy, why it's important, and how it can be used to build better products. More interestingly the primary focus of this will be that the first step to empathy is understanding oneself.
