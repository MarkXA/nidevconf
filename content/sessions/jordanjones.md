I recently participated in the AI NI 'The Good [A]Idea' Hackathon with next to no knowledge of ML. I did know a bit of JS though, which is obviously going to come in handy... right?

Enter TensorFlow.js - the perfect entry point for an AI newbie and JS fanboy.

In this lightning talk I'll give an overview of:
- our project
- what we used to build it
- the problems we had
- what we learned and what we'd do differently
- how I nearly developed carpal tunnel while training our model (see above point)

This talk is aimed at beginners mostly, because I am one too.
