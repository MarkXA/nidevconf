In an ever-evolving digital world trusting that someone is who they say they are, is harder than ever before.  
Checking somebodies' identity can involve a lot of manual checks and can be prone to human bias! 
As we move into the future with more remote jobs and even towards the metaverse, being able to perform automated identification checks has become more important! Whether you are an employer verifying someone's identity during recruitment or even a social media platform looking to switch to ID verification!
