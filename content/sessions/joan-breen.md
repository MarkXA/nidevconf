Help me ad a manager to help you as an engineer to achieve the performance, promotions and pay you would like. So many people don't communicate with their manager and then quit disappointed they didn't get what they wanted leaving a job they didn't want to leave which could have easily been avoided by talking - in this talk I'm going to cover how to talk to your manager about your performance, asking for more money and that promotion from the manager's side of the table including "un-promotional work", overview of a typical  promotion process,  what happens when you quit and expect a counter offer, evidence for performance and promotions, All those awkward conversations. Intension is for better outcomes and happier devs and managers for Northern Ireland
