AI is becoming more and more accessible, providing everyone with the capability to integrate intelligent decision making into their apps. AI services have made machine learning available on-demand, from language classification to object detection, raising the question-is it best to design your own model to solve a problem or pay for a service to do it for you? 

This talk will cover the key differences between build-your-own ML models and pay-as-you-go AI services, how to identify which offers the best solution to your problem, and how you can get started.
