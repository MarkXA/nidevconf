Packages are the building blocks from which our software systems are built. Whether it's `.deb`/`.rpm` packages installed on a server in your data-centre, Python wheels installed in your Docker container, or Go modules compiled into your binary, packages are everywhere.

Package managers are one of the tools we've traditionally used to manage the ever growing complexity of our software systems, but these days it's just as likely for a developer to shove all their source code directly into a Docker container and call it a day. By doing so we're losing out on years of experience, decades of knowhow and tooling, and making our build and delivery pipelines less efficient and manageable.

Join me for a dive into the history of software packaging and distribution. We'll explore some of the earliest attempts at making software distribution easier, all the way up to the current state of the art with containers and continuous delivery.

You *can* have the best of both worlds. Rock solid software packaging and distribution, and modern continuous delivery, *without* sacrificing the benefits of either.
