2 years ago(ish) my life changed forever, my son was born and there hasn't been a whole lot of sleep in our house since. You might not think a baby has much to teach an experienced engineer about software, but you'd be wrong.

This talk comprises a number of lessons, some old principles hammered home, and some entirely new i'd never even considered before.
