Every year the level of abstraction lifts and there are two type of engineer. Those who reject and those who embrace. If you are a developer who embraces change, it's never been better!

This talk will start to build on the simple concept of "writing code for a user" to "delivering outcomes at speed". All the latest cloud services put incredible power at the finger-tips of the developer, but with great abstraction comes great responsibility! 
Let's describe the Serverless concept, how AWS uses it to plug powerful services together. Then dive into the challenges with working in this way - performance, monitoring, cost, reliability, security..etc... Then jump into the Customer interaction, you can release really quickly, so there's a different way of working. Finally, focus on the different way of thinking and design systems - event driven, triggers and bounded context - not easy.
