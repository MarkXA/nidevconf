Vaguely star wars themed, Sequel to "A Node Hype". Live demo with some background, using rust, cargo, npmjs.com and web pack

Outline:

- Quick intro to WebAssembly
- Even quicker intro to rust
- Example of creating a rust package (crate)
- Publishing said crate to npmjs as wasm module
- Create a barebones html page in a clean environment (with no rust toolchain)
- Install rust crate/webassembly module from npm
- Embed the webassembly module in said html page
- Show it running, hopefully...

Summary:

- Come to the dark side we have performance and powerful types
- Examples of some other projects using webassembly for cool things
- Potential warnings/drawbacks, no more view source, etc.

If I have time:

- Brief sermon about formal reasoning being very powerful
- Implications in other areas (webassembly on the server? unikernels?)
- Some of my own Prognostication

Potential gags include:

- Some sort of language based you killed my father/I am your father joke.
- Disappointing prequels (flash, java)
- BIG CORPORATE (still a bit disappointing, but better) sequels (asmjs, PNACL)
- "I am the Senate/It's treason then" (reduced democratisation of the web)

Audience Outcomes:

- Awareness that WebAssembly exists
- Awareness of Rust
- Demo that webassembly is already practical, _now_.
- Pun exhaustion
- Where we are on the "Birth and Death of Javascript" timeline
