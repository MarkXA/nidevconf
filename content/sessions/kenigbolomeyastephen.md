Bad or non existent documentations are almost always the ripple effect of not writing documentation when it matters. In this talk I’ll take a quick deep dive into the importance of “Continuous Documentation” and how this is important for creating an amazing developer experience.

The importance of documentation cannot be over emphasised. In todays world where we have several buzz words with the suffix “continuous” e.g. “Continuous Integration”, “Continuous Deployment” etc. I believe it is imperative to introduce the audience to the concept of “Continuous Documentation”. Having encountered a documentation bottleneck at my current role as an Engineering Team Lead I coined the phrase “Continuous Documentation” which in plain language means the “Continuous writing and improvement of documentation along with development” hence the phrase “the best time to write the docs is now”.
