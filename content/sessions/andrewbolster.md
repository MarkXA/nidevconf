The technology community is known for being strongly inward looking; we focus on techniques, products, languages, frameworks, and best practices. 

However, some of the best outcomes and experiences come from pushing and stretching our boundaries outside of the safety of our wee community. 

In this talk, I'll be discussing some of the creative collisions I've come across; from using VR technologies to enable creative expression for disabled musicians, empowering artists to use electronics to connect their art to the wider world, and using science data to drive policy and political engagement.
