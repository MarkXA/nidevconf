In 2017 I bumbled my way into publishing physics research in Serbia. With terrible undergraduate Python code, I analysed lattice QCD supercomputer simulations Japan and discovered that we may have a fundamental misunderstanding about the forces which hold protons and neutrons together. 

I hope to teach the audience how to move the Eastern Europe for summer, live in a dormitory in a school for train conductors on Â£2 a day and conduct particle physics research. I hope they will leave with a basic understanding of a surprisingly fundamental open question in lattice QCD and a lot of sympathy for me.
