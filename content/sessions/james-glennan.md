Flying is one thing. Trying to justify to 100 people why you should change planes mid-air is another. Actually ferrying people between 2 planes while in-flight is near impossible, but we made it work.
This is a series of short stories that talk about the process we undertook to transition to Kubernetes, shifting our continuous integration and release process to Azure DevOps and the future for our Systems Architecture. We will discuss the real examples of how we accomplished retro-fitting our legacy systems, some of the teething problems with a new container orchestration workflow and championing the great benefits of the Cloud-Native approach, that weâ€™ve attained since beginning this process a little over 12 months ago. We will also talk about organisational and communication problems that result with big ticket changes and keeping the passengers happy and calm when the engine is on fire.
