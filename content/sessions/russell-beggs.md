Oftentimes as engineers we focus on the technical side of our learning. However, as we progress in our career we shouldn't neglect the more analytical and softer skills that can help us achieve more, be more productive and enjoy work more. From heuristics on troubleshooting to EQ and self-awareness, in this talk I aim to tell my younger self some things that I know now and I wish I knew then.
