Starting in with a speedy catch-up on what “web components” even means, this talk will focus on the various options available for building a site or app using web components.

The session will cover the available framework options for component based builds, and then showing how web components can be written in native browser technology (without the need for any frameworks!) and why this might be a good option to consider.

This talk is best suited for folks who have some familiarity with web development, and hopefully people will go away with an idea of whether or not web components are useful to them, and if so how they could implement them.
