This talk will focus on Design/Component Libraries - basically a set of design rules and standardised/templated UI components for a project.

We will look at why this technique has gained in popularity, and whether it's worth considering for your project. We'll look at the potential benefits and drawbacks with these systems depending on how they are implemented, and what should be avoided to make sure you don’t over-complicate your system, make development more difficult or encourage bad standards.

By the end of this talk, you should have a reasonable idea of whether or not a style guide and component library would be a good tool for your project, and what steps you should take to ensure the addition does not create further problems or complexities.
