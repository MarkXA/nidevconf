Just as Hephaestus built tools for the Gods, you too can create tools that give your team superpowers. Creating an environment where each team has the autonomy and capabilities to perform their jobs quickly and reliably is key to having a scalable business, reducing toil and avoiding team-based bottlenecks.

In this session we'll look at creating an automation platform from scratch, creating a sample job and running it. The goal of this talk is to spark some ideas about opportunities for improved velocity at your work place and to show that it's possible to get going without too much effort.
