This talk will introduce the audience to state charts in JavaScript by exploring the history of state machines, showcasing their benefits and the problems they help solve, and demonstrating how to take advantage of them today using XState.

A finite state machine is a mathematical model of how a particular piece of state can and should change. They can be used when planning and implementing software systems and this talk will discuss their uses when building a User Interface.
