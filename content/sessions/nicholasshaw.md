In this lightning talk I'll introduce the Software Testing Clinic (SWTC) that is launching in Belfast this June, I'll explain what it is, who it's for and give you a sampling of what participants can expect to learn from it.

SWTC offers completely free monthly evening sessions for anybody interested in the testing craft. They are run in an interactive way using whiteboard sessions, hands-on exercises and discussions as a group as well as in smaller teams to deepen our understanding of software testing.

We're seeking to spread the word about the SWTC to create awareness, find local experts to help mentor those less experienced and hopefully many in the community will benefit. This an incredible learning opportunity from those experienced in software testing to those who will be completely new to the field to flourish in their careers.

Help us create learning opportunities for those wishing to develop their testing knowledge, and show how practitioners of any parts of the craft can mentor and advance their own skills through the SWTC Belfast!
