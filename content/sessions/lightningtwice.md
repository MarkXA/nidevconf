Jason's talk is "Using Analogies: A common language for diverse teams":

Agile development has led to increased communication and collaboration within more diverse teams.  With that positive shift comes plenty of opportunity for misinterpretation, misunderstanding and stressed relationships.

Analogies are a great tool for communicating complex ideas & concepts in a way that everyone can understand their value.  They can even be fun and entertaining.

I will discuss how analogies can help with communication, dissonance and engagement by illustrating some I have used, including one for the often-fraught subject of Refactoring.   Find out how refactoring isnâ€™t just for code development, it also ensures you get a great meal at your favourite restaurant.

Vicky's talk is "NI Game Dev Scene":

Hi there! I did a talk on 'Student to Startup' last year. I'd like to do my 'I've levelled up a wee bit' talk - which is about the NI Game Dev scene in Northern Ireland and the tools that we use, for those who may not even know such a scene exists. 

The talk will roughly cover the following:

The Job of a Games Developer, Training & Skills Needed, What Do Games Companies Look For, What Development Software is Useful, Journey to Whitepot, The NI Games Development Industry.
