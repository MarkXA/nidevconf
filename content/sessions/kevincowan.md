Transforming an engineering culture can be really tough.  Change is not always welcome, it can be hard work and might push people out of their comfort zones.  It also might be brilliant!

Kevin will talk about joining ShopKeep and how he worked closely with their his peers to make necessary changes to team structures and product delivery processes.  He will also talk about change adoption, the challenges along the way and how to know if you have been successful.

By the end of the talk hopefully the audience will be inspired to change things in their own environments and will have some strategies to approach these transformations.
