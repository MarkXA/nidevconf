APIs are the interface between our users, the business & engineering. We all know these are important and even more so in the microservice world. Goa offers the opportunity to apply the lessons learned from Design Driven Development and apply an API first approach, allowing engineers to write transport agnostic business logic. 

goa takes a different approach to building micro-services. Instead of focusing solely on helping with implementation, goa makes it possible to describe the design of your API using a simple Go DSL. goa then uses that description to generate specialized service helper code, documentation, API clients, tests and even custom artifacts via plugins.
