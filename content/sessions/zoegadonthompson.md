I knew literally nothing about coding until I started to study. On my first day of Java at foundation degree level I had no clue what was going on. Everyone had some experience with computers, IT or gaming and I was light years behind. I was asking my peers for help and getting stuck on everything. I was really feeling like I'd made the wrong choice of career path.

To save myself from embarrassment I dove head first into the land of curly brackets and pizza meetups in an attempt to learn everything I could.

I'm going to share how I have managed an attempt at kick starting my career despite not knowing wtf I'm doing.
