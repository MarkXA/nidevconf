In a competitive working environment, peers compete fiercely to be the best, leading to a natural isolation to achieve more on their own. However, mature teams grow with each individual contributing towards a shared goal. Each with their speciality, experience and appetite, sharing what they know and helping each other. The result is a strong performing team, united and achieving way beyond the sum of its members.
