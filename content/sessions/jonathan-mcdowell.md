Much of the modern use of Go centres around backend infrastructure for websites, but it is touted as a modern systems programming language. This session will talk about the speakers experience of coming to Go from a C background and working with it in an environment where previously C or C++ might have been used. It's intended to provide the audience with an overview of the advantages and disadvantages experienced while developing with Go instead of C, without going into full scale advocacy about either or veering off into alternative languages.
