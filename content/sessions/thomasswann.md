In this talk we will discuss the value of good design in successfully delivering software and how this is a process in which everyone on a development team should get involved.

We will consider how taking some time to stop and think can help us to better tackle important issues such as technical debt or reduce the risk associated with technically challenging elements of our projects.

Attendees will learn how they can make design a core part of their team's workflow as I talk about my experience of using Open Design Proposals as a means of creating an inclusive process that demystifies the experience and helps everyone's voice to be heard.
