As a new CTO in a fast growing startup, beginning its journey from R&D to commercialisation the challenges of balancing tech, business vision and customer requirements is a continuous discussion. 

Over the past year we, at Secure Broadcast, have had to continuously reflect and improve our processes to maximise efficiency and ensure the right decisions were being made. This includes product and technology decisions that will shape the future of the tech stack and product roadmap. This talk will outline how we go about making these decisions and how we ensure we get the right people in the room at the right time.
