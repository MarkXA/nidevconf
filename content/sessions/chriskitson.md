Take the microservices paradigm and try to plug It into modern UI SPA frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) and you’ve got yourself a bit of an anti-pattern, right?

This talk will be a deep dive into breaking down a monolithic UI build to reverse the anti-pattern and allow the UI to be compose-able as smaller microservices (micro-frontends).

Once we identify the problem, we will look at the deployment architecture followed by a quick look at what technologies could help us to solve the problem.
