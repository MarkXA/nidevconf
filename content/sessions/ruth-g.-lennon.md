The new IEEE P2675 draft standard for DevOps: Building Reliable and Secure Systems including Application Build, Package and Deployment is currently in the voting phase. This session explores the major topics in DevOps which are essential to standardising this process. The standard itself is not finalized and these are the opinions of the presenter. At the end of the session attendees will be able to understand what changes are required by an organisation in order to apply a standard where fundamental development concepts must change.
