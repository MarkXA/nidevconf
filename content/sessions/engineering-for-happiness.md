Through the pandemic we’ve developed a number of coping mechanisms that have allowed us all to address the challenges this new world presents us. 
Many of these responses are reactive - responding to problems that have arisen. 
Problems with burnout are typically framed at the individual level and our mitigation strategies focus on healing after the fact.
What if instead we took a more proactive approach and designed our work around being happy. 
What would that look like and how could we make it happen?
In this talk I’ll discuss some of the theory behind happiness as well as walking through some practical steps we’ve taken to build a more purposeful and effective organisation.
