### Transport

Due to construction work on a new teaching block at Riddel Hall, a very limited amount of parking will be available on site and we request that these spaces be left for visitors with accessibility requirements. We recommend using public transport if possible, but the free Stranmillis Road public car park is a 400 yard walk from the venue and on-street parking is free on Saturdays.

Bicycle stands are available.

The nearest train station is Botanic, approximately 1 mile from the venue.

Bus service 8a runs twice an hour from the city centre to the Stranmillis Mews stop outside Riddel Hall, also stopping on Bradbury Place near Botanic Station.
