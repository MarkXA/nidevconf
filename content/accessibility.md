# Access and Accessibility

We are keen to make this event as accessible to the widest group of technologists as we can. While we aim to preemptively address needs where possible, if you do have any concerns about the level of access provided, or specific requirements, please get in touch via <a href='mailto:inbox@nidevconf.com'>inbox@nidevconf.com</a> or one of our organizing team directly.

Carers are welcome free-of-charge - our system will allow self-selected ticket booking at zero cost, but if preferred, you are welcome to contact us to book a ticket for a carer directly.

All presentation areas are on the ground floor, and accessible bathrooms are available where marked on the floorplan below. Free Blue Badge and Parent-Toddler parking is available at the front of Riddel Hall. An access ramp to the right of the main entrance, when facing the building, provides step-free access. Within the building, some corridors have step/lift connections, although you may find alternate routes which may be preferable (for example, in front of the Raked Lecture Theatre). Induction loops are available within the rooms.</p>

A Quiet Room is available on the ground floor, marked QR in the floorplan. We would ask those using the space to refrain from carrying on conversations or taking phone-calls in this room.

While we will not be able to provide live captioning or signing this year, if you would be benefited by suitable seat reservation, or there are other ways we can facilitate your experience of the event, please get in touch via <a href='mailto:inbox@nidevconf.com'>inbox@nidevconf.com</a> or one of our organizing team directly.

We would encourage anyone presenting to have a look through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/">W3C presentation accessibility material</a>. If you have issues with the accessibility of presentations or slide-decks, we would encourage you to feed this back to the conference team, and some speakers have opted to receive feedback via <a href="https://joind.in/event/northern-ireland-developer-conference-2018">joind.in</a>.

If there is information that you feel should be here, but is not, please let us know at <a href='inbox@nidevconf.com'>inbox@nidevconf.com</a>.
