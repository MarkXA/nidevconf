## Your ticket options

From Â£45 down to free, we have a range of ticket options to suit all budgets.

### Early Bird

Look out for our Early Bird ticket releases on our social channels. These tickets are limited in number and will be available on a first come, first served basis.

### Standard

Once Early Bird tickets are gone, standard price tickets will be available until the day of the event.

### Concessionary

BOTH Early Bird and Standard tickets are available at a heavily discounted concessionary rate for students, unwaged, etc. Just enter the relevant discount code on the booking page.

### Honesty

While we've done our best to keep tickets affordable, we also offer "honesty" tickets for those on a tight budget. Just pay what you can.
