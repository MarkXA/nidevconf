TypeScript is a type safe superset of JavaScript. It allows you to develop codebases that are more elegant, error-free and maintainable than their JavaScript equivalents. TypeScript is rapidly growing in popularity for both UI creation (in Angular and React) and Serverless development (via the AWS Cloud Development Kit). Unlike alternatives like Elm, Reason and PureScript you can explore the language incrementally and leverage your existing JavaScript knowledge.

This single day workshop will introduce you to TypeScript. We will provide an overview of the language that touches on all of its features. This will include:

* Creating standalone TypeScript projects via WebPack.
* Configuring the behaviour and outputs of the Transpiler.
* Using TypeScript to access the latest JavaScript features.
* Safer coding via type inference, interfaces and generics.
* Making higher order functions intelligible via type signatures.
* Enhanced typing via aliases, unions, intersections and literals.
* Type Driven Development with mapped and recursive types. 

Attendees should be confident JavaScript developers, who are familiar with the basics of Node.js and NPM. Full details of setup and all the course materials will be provided in advance of the delivery, which will be conducted virtually via Zoom.
