A Lightning Decision Jam is a condensed design thinking workshop which can help teams generate and prioritise actionable solutions to various problems. This process uses the four principles of design sprints:

* Work together, alone. Independently come up with ideas, allowing quieter voices to share their thoughts.
* Tangible items are better than discussion. Reduce the risk of different interpretations
* Getting started is more important than being right
* Don't rely on creativity. Good ideas can come from anywhere.

Using the Visual Collaboration tool Mural, over 1 hour we will as a group discuss the impact of lockdown measures on networking events. We will be participating in the following actions in hopes of addressing a problem currently affecting the industry:

1. Identify and define the problem quickly
2. Come up with a lot of solutions
3. Find the best solution/next step, based on identifying the effort and impact of the best solutions
4. Arrive at clear action steps that can start being implemented as soon as the meeting is over

There are no pre-requisites for this workshop.
