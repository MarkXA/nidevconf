                <h1>The Northern Ireland Developer Conference 2019</h1>
                <h3>Why?</h3>
                <p>
                    The software development scene in Northern Ireland has exploded over the past few years.
                    Meetups have sprung up left, right and centre covering all sorts of weird and wonderful technologies, as well as all the old favourites.     
                    What we've discovered is that while attending meetups in areas you're already somewhat familiar with is great, you really learn and grow as a developer by looking outside your silo and seeing what goes on elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that in mind, we decided it was time to put together a conference where all developers could come together and learn from each other, while at the same time celebrating the range of amazing work going on in Northern Ireland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2018 conference was a great success. We hope 2019 will be even better!
                </p>
                <h3>Who?</h3>
                <p>
                    Inquiring minds. We want to reach as many developers as possible, so we're aiming for content that'll be interesting and inspiring whether you're a student, a novice developer or an old hand. We're particularly keen to see devs from under-represented groups and will welcome everyone with open arms, a <a class="subtle" href="/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a> and pay-what-you-can tickets.
                </p>
                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>
                    The core of the conference will of course be technical <a class="subtle" href="/agenda/">talks</a>. We'll have speakers from around Northern Ireland speaking on a range of technologies and disciplines, from security and devops to data and game dev.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as talks, we'll have a number of other things going on. The exact details are still being hammered out, but will likely involve some live coding, panel or open space discussions, interactive exhibitor stands and <a class="subtle" href="mailto:info@nidevconf.com">some other things suggested by the community</a>.
