# What is NIDC?

TL;DR it's an annual chance for the Northern Irish tech community to get together, learn, make connections and have fun.

## What makes it different to other conferences?

As with most conferences, it is based around a core of technical talks, but:

* It's for the **whole tech community**. There's no bias in terms of technologies, roles or experience - whether you're a front-end dev, back-end dev, data engineer, product manager, team lead or student, we've got stuff for you.

* Everyone's equal. No speakers get special billing, and we make a point of being a great place for people to give their first talk, with **free help** from experienced speakers all the way from preparing submissions to practicing the finished talk.

* It's inclusive. It's our goal to provide you with the **friendliest, safest environment possible** where nobody feels out of place, particularly those from under-represented groups. Even kids are welcome, and **free professional childcare** is provided all day if you need it.

* It's affordable. Even the full-price tickets are a fraction of the cost of most other events, and if it's still beyond you then we have **pay-what-you-can tickets**.

* It's **fun**. Everyone's there to have a good time, and we always have some fun activities if you need a break from the talks.
