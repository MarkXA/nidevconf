Stephen spends (what some would call) a disturbing amount of time writing software but would probably give it up for the opportunity to live on a cat island. He can often be found drinking tea, and muttering about the accuracy of cricket statistical data. He is possibly powered by sarcasm. He is uncertain about writing about himself in the third person.
