Stephen has failed to move to a cat island since last year, so has returned. He is partial to cats (unsurprisingly), tea, and sumo, and will happily look at any pictures of your cats that you care to share. He has never met a pun he didn't like. He wonders whether this blurb will be read out before his talk, and how the presenter will deal with the word "onomatopoeia" in that case. He clearly hasn't learned how to write biographies since last year, and still doubts the wisdom of writing about himself in the third person.
