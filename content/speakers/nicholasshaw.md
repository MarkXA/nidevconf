Nick is currently a software engineer with Puppet.

He has worked as a developer, a support engineer, a tester and a shelf stacker! But right now he is fascinated by efficiency and loves to optimise feedback systems to be quicker, offer more clarity, as well as proving more reliable. 

He enjoys the variety that working as a tester provides him with most of all. In the same day he can find himself head down in an IDE, having high-level discussions about the effectiveness of an upcoming feature to address business needs and looking over analytics to see where he should focus his testing efforts.

Nick likes to learn while helping others and does so by co-organising the NI Testers meetup as well as helping out at Code Club Holywood. You can find him on twitter @Shicky4 or at his blog www.nicholaspshaw.com
