Angie is a Security Architect at Microsoft in one of the CTO teams. She is focused on identity security in Azure, taking care of delivery readiness for field employees and doing technical quality assurance on security deals and deliveries. She has a Masters in Applied Cyber Security, and is fascinated by Digital Forensics.

Her background is really varied; she's been a teacher, made VR things, run a bookstore, owned an Artisan Tea company, and also worked as web/app developer. One of her first ever jobs was in an internet cafe run by the council (before people had it in their homes) teaching people what hyperlinks were and how to use Yahoo! She also founded the NI Game Dev Network, and is now on the steering committee for InfosecNI.

She is on Twitter constantly, enjoys learning Mandarin and watching c-dramas, kpop, games, and going to tech meetups. Her favourite thing in the world is brunch with friends, and her best life tip is Get More Sleep.
