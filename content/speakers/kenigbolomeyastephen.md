I'm Kenigbolo Meya Stephen, Full Stack Software Engineer working as the Frontend Engineering Team Lead at BCaster OY. Formerly Arch Conveyer/Community Manage of CodeAfrique (now Reload), a not-for-profit weekend intensive software engineering bootcamp for underrepresented groups in IT based out of Estonia.

During my free time I sometimes volunteer as an open source developer for https://adsbexchange.com, play golf and coach football (soccer as Americans call it). I also have a nick for writing tiny javascript modules on npm to help a few developers out there so they need not rewrite same utilities that we all might need (usually it's the case that we're only a handful needing those so there's really nothing too worry much about).
