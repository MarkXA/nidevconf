Ciaran spent twenty years working in application development, the last ten in the areas of secure development and security engineering, before finally moving across into information security last year. He's proud to be a member of the steering committee for the NI Cybersecurity Cluster, an organisation bringing together Northern Ireland's private, public, and education sectors to help grow the sector in Northern Ireland. 

Ciaran is also a writer who has written numerous movie reviews and historical articles. He has found that studying history helps to give an understanding of human nature that changes how you look at IT. It was through this writing that he was persuaded to give a talk about the history of Phoenix Park, which eventually led to him speaking at technical conferences from Boston to London over the last several years. In his very occasional spare time he enjoys sleep and looking at pictures of cats.
