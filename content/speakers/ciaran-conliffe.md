Ciaran is a technologist at Liberty IT, where he's worked on everything from automated application security to online customer service portals. Currently he is working in software development for identity management and doing his best to bring user-centric thinking to the world of information security.

Ciaran is also a writer with a regular history column at Headstuff.org (currently on hiatus(, and has found that studying history helps to drive the cynicism about human nature that you need for working in IT security. It was through this column that he was persuaded to give a talk about the history of Phoenix Park, which improbably led to him speaking at technical conferences from Boston to London over the last three years (well, up until six months ago). In his very occasional spare time he enjoys sleep and looking at pictures of cats.
