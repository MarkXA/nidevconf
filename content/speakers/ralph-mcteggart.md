Like most devs I'm a geek through and through. My background is mostly backend web services although I can sometimes be found writing frontend code or creating practical examples of machine learning. I don't hold any prejudice around tools/frameworks languages as long as the problem is solved, ideally in a simple but interesting way. With that said: Vim is life.
