I'm a 28 year old senior software engineer living in Lisburn. I've been a professional engineer for 6 years, working at Liberty Information Technology (LIT) which is a IT software company for Liberty Mutual Insurance.

I started a few years before a massive agile transformation came my way and switched my technical focus from .Net to Java and react/redux/typescript and onto AWS services before getting my certification.
