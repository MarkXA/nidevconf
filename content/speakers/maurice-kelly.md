Maurice Kelly, or Mo to his friends (psssst, that includes you!), is a Director of Engineering at Magnite, the worldâ€™s largest independent sell-side ad platform. He likes to hang out as @mo on the NI Tech Slack, where he is willing to give his opinion about nearly every subject under the sun and moon. Despite having more of a focus on people responsibility he still loves to mess around with (non-volatile) code and is prone to buying music equipment that he promises to use any day now.
