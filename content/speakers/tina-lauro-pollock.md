Tina is one of two directors at Belfast-based game studio Brain and Nerd, where she spends her time managing production across multiple ambitious games projects. Brain and Nerd is currently working on Hortalius, an ambient exploration game that recently received Creative Europe MEDIA funding, and INCubator, a tongue-in-cheek startup management simulation game that was dreamed up through rapid prototyping and has since received UK Games Fund backing.
