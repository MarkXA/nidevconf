Zoe loves creative problem solving and getting massive headaches, especially when it focuses on things that put her out of her comfort zone and force her to learn new things like maths and physics in programming. 

Her best accomplishment to date has been the personal and professional progress she has made in the last year, which include studying a foundation degree in software engineering, organising numerous events, ~10 public speaking events, and (almost) successfully raising a toddler. Also, getting a job as a professional nerd at Flax & Teal.

She tries to be actively involved in the Belfast tech community, organising events and encouraging other organisers to make events family friendly.
