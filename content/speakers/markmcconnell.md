Senior developer at whitespace ventures

Background in building highly performant web applications for some of the worldâ€™s largest brands, including Ford, Red Bull and Google. Recently moved towards the fintech sector working with creating large scale data monitoring systems for trades. While my day to day job is working with python, I'm often found working on everything from project management to devops.
