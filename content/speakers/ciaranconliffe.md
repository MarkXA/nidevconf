Ciaran is a technologist at Liberty IT, where he's worked on everything from automated application security to online customer service portals. Currently he is the technical lead for their Risk & Security unit, and is doing his best to bring user-centric thinking to the world of information security.

Ciaran is also a writer with a regular history column at Headstuff.org, and has found that studying history helps to drive the cynicism about human nature that you need for working in IT security. It was through this column that he was persuaded to give a talk about the history of Phoenix Park, which improbably led to him speaking at technical conferences from Boston to London over the last two years. In his very occasional spare time he enjoys sleep and looking at pictures of cats.
