For over 30 years Paul has been immersed within leadership and management roles: beginning his career as an officer candidate leading to ten years in the USAF as an Officer in B-52 Operations, before going on to host multiple roles in leadership positions within the software industry.  During his ten years in the Air Force, Paul has acted as a B-52 Navigator, Flight Operations scheduler, Radar Navigator, and Director of Current Operations for Minot Air Force Base.  Working in the field of operations with the Air Force has given Paul the appreciation and capability of making high quality, fast-paced, critical decisions in high pressure situations.  After leaving the Air Force, he used his prolific experience in leadership and Computer Science to build and lead software development teams. Paul has over nine years of experience with managing 24x7 operations for SaaS solutions. Additionally, he joined Bazaarvoice in 2014, quickly becoming a leader in R&D assisting and kick-starting its transformation into a lean and agile organization.

"I firmly believe that quality is the #1 thing when building software.  Ultimately, if you sacrifice quality in order to finish a product sooner the cost to the client, consumer, and company is greater than anyone anticipates.  In the past 3.5 years in which I have been with Bazaarvoice, my teams have delivered a tremendous amount of value with a 'quality-first' mentality and I look forward to bringing similar success into building the Bazaarvoice Belfast Office and R&D team."
