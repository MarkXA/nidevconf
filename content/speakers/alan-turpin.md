I am a Senior Software Development Engineer at ESO. I have had 10 years’ experience within software development working on projects entirely software related and with mechanical components. Previously I worked for Randox Laboratories and CEM Systems. I have experience in C++, Classic ASP but mostly I develop in .NET. I graduated from University of Ulster Coleraine in 2008 with a degree in Computing. I completed a PhD at University of Ulster Coleraine in 2012 titled “Automated Identification of Retinal Cones In Vivo”.
