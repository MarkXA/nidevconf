I entered technology later than most at age 30. I have two children who are neurodiverse and I also have a diagnosis of autism and ADHD myself. I  think it's important that people continue to advocate for diversity in the workplace and this means understanding the needs of a diverse workforce. One size doesn't fit all and employers need to be open to being educated, making changes and offering adjustments.
