I am a Computing Science student at Ulster University. 
Have previously worked as an intern at Liberty IT and most recently as an intern within Flax and Teal LTD. 
I helped setup the Computing Society at Ulster University Jordanstown and was selected to be a Nigma Community Ambassador in August 2019. I thoroughly enjoy getting involved with the tech community here in NI.
