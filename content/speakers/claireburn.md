She recently completed an MSc in Cyber Security at QUB, passing with Distinction after completing her BEng Computer Science a year prior. She has spent 5 years in leadership roles in the Belfast branch of the global not-for-profit organization Women Who Code, which she recently stepped down from, and 

she received a UK-wide TechWomen50 award for her diversity & inclusion work during this time. She is the founder of the Google-sponsored Women Techmakers Belfast conference, which aims to highlight the work and achievements of local women in STEM, which has been running for 4 successful years now.  She has spoken at many conferences and events, most notably AppSec EU and the international “Women In Leadership In a Changing World”. In her (rare) moments of free time, she enjoys cooking, singing, drinking tea and playing “Dungeons & Dragons” with friends."
