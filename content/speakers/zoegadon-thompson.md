I'm nearly finished my first year of a foundation degree in software engineering. I started to study at 21, after working minimum wage in a call centre and having a baby. I want her to have a mum who's successful and passionate, and I'm at least half of those things already. I'm trying to get my name known and my skills developed so I can make some of my ideas come to life through the support of the tech community.
