I am an MEng Computer Science Graduate from Queens University Belfast (QUB) and currently a Computer Science PhD student at QUB studying the use of AI in smart wearable devices (with a focus on medical devices) and finding new ways to reduce bias in these devices. 
I am also the founder and CEO of Axonnr, a robotics company based in Armagh working on combining the latest developments of AI and robotics to advance robotic prosthetic technology.
