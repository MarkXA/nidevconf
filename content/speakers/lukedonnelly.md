Luke is a graduate of the games program at Ulster University. There he developed a tool for reconstruction of 3D audio signals. At axial3D he applies those skills to reconstruct 3D medical imaging data and display it in the platform. He is funded by InnovateUK in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with Ulster University.
James is a physics graduate from Trinity College Dublin and has been working on axial3D's machine learning algorithms. He is working in collaboration with University College Dublin's School of Medicine on MRI analysis of hearts funded by InterTradeIreland. 
Together we have developed a number of key parts of the axial3D platform working on data integration and visualisation. We will talk about the tools we have used as well as the results of our work to date which have been presented at a number of international conferences, most recently VizBi.
