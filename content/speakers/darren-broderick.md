Hello, I'm a Senior Software Engineer and have been a  professional engineer for 7 years, working at Liberty Information Technology (LIT) which is a IT software company for Liberty Mutual Insurance.

I've grown a real passion for Machine Learning in the last year thanks to AWS DeepRacer and using what I've learnt to become more practical in AL/AI tech.
