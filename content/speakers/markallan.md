Mark is an Azure MVP based on the beautiful North Coast. He's been a professional developer since the 1980s and freelance since 2000, working on a myriad of projects for everything from local startups and councils to multinational corporations and federal government departments. While something of a technology omnivore, particularly if it's new and shiny, he currently tends towards Xamarin and React front-ends sitting on top of scalable Azure services, using a functional and reactive approach. In his spare time he's a STEM Ambassador, CoderDojo mentor, Barefoot volunteer and organiser of the Northern Ireland Developer Conference.
