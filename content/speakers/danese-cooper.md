Danese Cooper has been an outspoken Free and Open Source Software activist for more than 20 years. Over that time she has consistently worked for the health and welfare of the FOSS movement at jobs such as CTO of Wikipedia, Chief Open Source Evangelist for Sun, Senior Director of Open Source Strategy for Intel, and Board Member with the Drupal Association, the Open Hardware Foundation and the Open Source Initiative. Seven years ago while running PayPal's OSPO, Danese started thinking, talking, and writing about InnerSource as the logical next step to sustain the FOSS movement. Today, Danese is a director of the InnerSourceCommons.org, a US 501(c)3 non-profit. She still consults on Open Source (and InnerSource) via DaneseWorks, Ltd and lives in Western Ireland.
