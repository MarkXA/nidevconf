                <h1>The Northern Ireland Developer Conference Exhibition Area</h1>
                <h2>On the day</h3>
                <p>Arrival Times: From 8am onwards</p>
                <p>Departure Times: From 5pm onwards</p>
                <p>
                 You are located in the main area of the conference. This is where all catering is served for the day and the main meeting point. This area will have a lot of foot fall especially around lunch time and the afternoon snack.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Places in the exhibition area are based on first come first served basis as all places have equal foot fall.  
                </p>
                <h2>Equipment available</h3>
                <p>
                  We advise to bring your own pull up banners to decorate your exhibition area.
                  Each stand has the following:
                  <ul>
                    <li>- Trestle table</li>
                    <li>- Power Extension lead connection</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Exhibitors layout</h3>
                <p>
                  Here is the layout on the day. There are 3 entrances to the main area.

                <h3>Ideas for Swag</h3>
                <p>
                 The conference is commited to being environmentally sustainable. Swag can be a source of landfill waste. As you will see, no waste will be produced on the day and this is a very attractive to our attendees. The conference itself will give out minimum items for the day and does not provide bags. This helps eliminate the landfill waste. Conferences have a reputation of producing a lot of landfill waste through Swag items. Swag is not necessary for your exhibition stand but if you are providing any we have some ideas.

                <h3>Ideas for attracting developers</h3>
                <p>
                    <li>- Have them sign up for a competition. We can announce it at the opening and closing parts of the day. You can tweet about it and we will retweet from our account.</li>
                    <li>- Code Challenge: Give them code on a page. See if they can find all the things wrong with it</li>
                    <li>- VR/AR experience with a product you are developing</li>
                    <li>- Screen with an interactive program like chatbots / games / blockchain / AI etc.</li>
                    <li>- Your own great ideas :)</li>

                  We visited the main area when there were exhibitors present for another conference. Here is when there are less people in the area.
