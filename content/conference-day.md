## Getting there

### By public transport

The ICC is a short walk from Lanyon Place Station, and the Waterfront bus stop is right outside the venue and serviced by a large number of routes. We suggest using the [Translink app](https://www.translink.co.uk/UsingOurServicesandProducts/OurApps/JourneyPlannerApp) to plan your journey.

### By bike

There are cycle hoops outside the Waterfront Hall entrance of the building, and the Waterfront Belfast Bike stand is also directly outside the venue.

### By car

Discounted parking is available at the [APCOA Lanyon Place car park](https://goo.gl/maps/kY77gfY7MKkEic7d8) (note **NOT** the Oxford Street car park adjacent to the Waterfront Hall - it's a little further along Lanyon Place). To avail of the discounted £10 day rate, visit https://citycentre.apcoa.co.uk/ and prebook using the following details:

* Select parking location **Lanyon Place**
