# Conference Day

Here are all the details you should need for the day of the conference:

## Timings

Registration is between 8:30am and 9:30am. Lunch is 12pm-1pm, and the conference finishes by 6:15pm. There is then an afterparty at the Black Box.

## Mobile app

You can install the Sessionize app at https://nidc22.sessionize.com/ to view the agenda and set up your own personal schedule.

## Getting there

The ICC is in the Waterfront Hall building. Please use the [Riverside Entrance](https://goo.gl/maps/HBpsZp54xJoYbWHG6), not the Waterfront Hall entrance!

### By public transport

The ICC is a short walk from Lanyon Place Station, and the Waterfront bus stop is right outside the venue and serviced by a large number of routes. We suggest using the [Translink app](https://www.translink.co.uk/UsingOurServicesandProducts/OurApps/JourneyPlannerApp) to plan your journey.

### By bike

There are cycle hoops outside the Waterfront Hall entrance of the building, and the Waterfront Belfast Bike stand is also directly outside the venue.

### By car

Discounted parking is available at the [APCOA Lanyon Place car park](https://goo.gl/maps/kY77gfY7MKkEic7d8) (note NOT the Oxford Street car park adjacent to the Waterfront Hall - it's a little further along Lanyon Place). To avail of the discounted £10 day rate, visit https://citycentre.apcoa.co.uk/ and use the following details:

* Select parking location Lanyon Place
* Choose Day Parking (£20)
* Select date and time for entry and exit
* Enter promo code **con10** to reduce the price to £10

## Food and drink

Tea, coffee and biscuits will be available during registration and again during the afternoon break.

A light lunch will be provided at 12pm. A separate station will cater for attendees with allergies - look for the Allergen Champion wearing a green apron.

Water will be available throughout the day - please bring your own refillable bottle if you can.

## Assistance

NIDC committee and volunteers will be wearing branded pink t-shirts. Feel free to ask us for help with anything during the day.

## After party

After the conference you're welcome to join us in the Black Box to chill out with a drink or two. Remember to bring your conference badge with you to gain entry!
