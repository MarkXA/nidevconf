# Sponsorship

## Why become a sponsor?

NIDC isn’t just all about developers. We’re devoted to inviting everyone who works in tech in Northern Ireland to join in the event. Our research has shown that a considerable number of people are eager to take part.

To make more room, we’ve doubled our team of volunteer organisers, and we’re increasing the capacity of the event so we can double the number of guests!

## What can you expect?

A high quality community conference with over 500 attendees with an interest in tech.

A great opportunity to promote your company and raise your brand awareness, NIDC will ensure that your brand is seen between the in-person attendees and social media.

A chance for members of your team to speak in front of an attentive audience, whether it be their latest project for the company or a technology they’re passionate about.

## Interested in learning more?
