# Call for Speakers

<a class="btn" href="{{<param cfpurl>}}">Submit a talk now! &raquo;</a>

## Why NIDC?

NIDC is unique because...

- It's an open call for speakers working in the tech sector. We're not looking for "rockstars" - some of our best talks have been from students, and even managers ;)
- We select a diverse range of topics. If you're willing to talk about it, we're willing to listen.
- There are different formats including lightning talks (great for easily getting "**conference speaker**" on your CV!) and panels. 

By the way, speakers get a free ticket. So if you’ve bought your ticket, and you’re chosen to speak, we’ll refund you!

## Who are we looking for?

**Anyone!** If you've never spoken before, we'd love to have you. We're happy to **help novice speakers through the entire process from submission to delivery** (just email [{{<param email>}}](mailto:{{<param email>}})), and as well as normal talks we'll also be running lightning talks for speakers who have something to say but don't want to spend too long saying it. Of course, if you're an experienced speaker, we'd still love to have you ;)

## What should talks be about?

**Anything of interest to the tech community!** We've seen all kinds of presentations, such as live demos, tutorials, and stories of trials and triumphs. Folks from many fields have joined NIDC:
- Software
- Design
- Infrastructure
- UX
- Testing
- Leadership
- Security
- Game Dev
- DevOps
- Project
- Data
- Students
- Architecture
- ...and more than we can even remember to mention!

You're working on interesting stuff, either in your day job or as a side project. Why not come and tell us about it? The tools, methodologies and approaches that have helped you out, how you've addressed technical or non-technical pain points, or just showing off something fun.

For examples of talks in previous years, check out the NIDC YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/NIDevConf/videos

## What should I put in my submission?

There are no rules, but if you're not sure then try something like this:

* Talk title - Short and catchy
* Talk description - The situation that led you to thinking of this talk, what you did/can do about it, and what the audience will learn from hearing about it
* Bio - What you do professionally, any interesting or relevant background, something about you outside work (if you want)

If you want advice or a sanity check, email us at [{{<param email>}}](mailto:{{<param email>}}). And don't worry, you can make changes to your submission right up to the deadline.

## How long should talks be?

Standard talks should last for 30 minutes. Lightning talks should be up to 10 minutes.

## When do submissions close?

Proposals must be submitted by Sunday 13th August (at 23:59:59).
