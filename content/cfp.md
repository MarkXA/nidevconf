# Call for Speakers

<a class="btn" href="{{<param cfpurl>}}">Submit a talk now! &raquo;</a>

## Advice calls

If you need any help submitting your talk (deciding whether to submit at all, choosing a subject, writing the submission, etc), join one of our Zoom advice sessions:

- [Wednesday 24th August, 8:30pm - 9:30pm](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89920365914?pwd=bmVOR3l4SlF2YTMwSzF4WFpDM3Y2Zz09)
- [Thursday 25th August, 7:00pm - 8:00pm](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89015946111?pwd=SXNnVlJhSXNtdGJBb0NPT0JrL1QxUT09)

If you can't make either of those, email us at [{{<param email>}}](mailto:{{<param email>}}) to arrange a personal consultation :)

## Why NIDC?

NIDC is unique because...

- It's an open call for speakers working in the tech sector in Northern Ireland. We're not looking for "rockstars" - some of our best talks have been from students and even managers ;)
- We select a diverse range of topics. If you're willing to talk about it, we're willing to listen.
- There are different formats including lightning talks (great for easily getting "**conference speaker**" on your CV!) and panels. 

By the way, speakers get a free ticket. So if you’ve bought your ticket, and you’re chosen to speak, we’ll refund you!

## Who are we looking for?

**Anyone!** If you've never spoken before, we'd love to have you. We're happy to **help novice speakers** with preparation and advice, and as well as normal talks we'll also be running lightning talks for speakers who have something to say but don't want to spend too long saying it. Of course, if you're an experienced speaker, we'd still love to have you ;)

## What should talks be about?

**Anything of interest to the tech community!** We've seen all kinds of presentations, such as live demos, tutorials, and stories of trials and triumphs. Folks from fields in Software, Infrastructure, Security, Product, UX, and Design have joined NIDC.

You're working on interesting stuff, either in your day job or as a side project. Why not come and tell us about it? The tools, methodologies and approaches that have helped you out, how you've addressed technical or non-technical pain points, or just showing off something fun.

For examples of talks in previous years, check out the NIDC YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/NIDevConf/videos

## How long should talks be?

Standard talks should last for 30 minutes. Lightning talks should be no more than 10 minutes.

## When do submissions close?

Proposals must be submitted by Sunday 28th August (at 23:59:59).

## Where do I submit my talk?
