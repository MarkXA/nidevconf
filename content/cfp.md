                <h3>Who are we looking for?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Anyone!</strong>
                    If you've never spoken before, we'd love to have you. We're happy to <strong>help novice speakers</strong> with preparation and advice, and as well as normal talks we'll also be running lightning talks for speakers who have something to say but don't want to spend too long saying it. Of course, if you're an experienced speaker, we'd still love to have you ;)
                </p>
                <h3>What should talks be about?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Anything of interest to developers!</strong>
                    You're working on interesting stuff, either in your day job or as a side project. Why not come and tell us about it? The ideal talk would be:
                        <ul style="list-style:disc; padding-left:2em">
                            <li>About something cool being built in Northern Ireland</li>
                            <li>Technical, explaining the technologies that make it tick and why they were chosen, or non-technical but addressing common developer pain points</li>
                            <li>Accessible to developers from a broad range of backgrounds</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                <h3>How long should talks be?</h3>
                <p>
                    Standard talks should last for 30 minutes. Lightning talks should be no more than 10 minutes.
                </p>
                <h3>When do submissions close?</h3>
                <p>
                  Proposals must be submitted by Monday 1st April (at 23:59:59).
                </p>
                <h3>Where do I submit my talks?</h3>
