# Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

**Official photography**: Please note that we have an official photographer, David Kane. If you do wish to participate in the event but do not wish for your photograph to be taken in individual or small group photos, please make yourself known to him on arrival (the team at the Info Desk will help you do so). Please bear in mind that you may appear in crowd photographs.

**Attendee photography**: With the exception of speakers while on stage (where a no-recording announcement has not been made), if you wish to take a photograph where someone is the specific focus of the photograph, please ask their permission first.

## Need Help?

Contact us at inbox@nidevconf.com or talk to any of our volunteers or committee on site (who will be wearing NIDC shirts). 

## The Quick Version

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
    regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
    appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not
    tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
    appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online
    media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
    conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age,
    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion,
    technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
    harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, unwelcome
    attempts at recruitment, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use
    sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
    sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they
    deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns,
    please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as
    they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law
    enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
    duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related
    social events.
