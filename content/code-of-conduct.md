                <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
                <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the
                    following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect
                    cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>
                <p> <b>Official photography</b>: please note that we have an official photographer, David Kane. If you
                    do wish to participate in the event but do not wish for your photograph to be taken in individual or
                    small group photos, please make yourself known to him on arrival (the team at the Info Desk will
                    help you do so). Please bear in mind that you may appear in crowd photographs.<br /> <b>Attendee
                        photography</b>: with the exception of speakers while on stage (where a no-recording
                    announcement has not been made), if you wish to take a photograph where someone is the specific
                    focus of the photograph, please ask their permission first. </p>

                <h3>The Quick Version</h3>
                <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
                    regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
                    appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not
                    tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
                    appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online
                    media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
                    conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
                <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
                <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age,
                    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion,
                    technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
                    harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, unwelcome
                    attempts at recruitment, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
                <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use
                    sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
                    sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
                <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they
                    deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
                </p>
                <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns,
                    please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as
                    they&#39;ll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>
                <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
                    enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
                    duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
                <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related
                    social events.</p>
