There is no hard and fast definition but one of the best ways to try and answer this question is to look at some of the general principles in the context of a real world project. The project was initiated to create tools to help people in the open data industry; it used open source software and the project team was about as open as it gets.\n\nSo, how did it come about? What were the processes used? What was the outcome? and was the project successful? These are all things we will see at as we look at this in more detail."

It will look at why this data is important and why we'd want to instrument parts of our lives, discussing tooling for extraction. Finally it will then move on to how we can take all of this data and combine it to provide context, gaining insights by making it more useful than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe aim is for the audience to see some of the information we inadvertently give out about our lives, that we can actively record or retrieve that information, and the ways we can combine that information to gain better insight about ourselves. Hopefully they will be inspired to look into the data they own across the services they use and think about what parts of their lives they'd want to record and measure."

Since then, cryptocurrencies have an estimated market value of $425 billion (as of time of writing). \n\nMost people who are aware of crypto have typically heard of the two \"B's\" - Bitcoin and Blockchain. The former, created in 2009, is a type of digital currency and was the first ever decentralised cryptocurrency. It has been coined the digital gold of the 21st century, and it's popularity lead to the creation of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies which are commonly known as alt-coins (alternative coins). At the heart of Bitcoin and many of these alt-coins, they employ a technology known as a Blockchain. Being one of the core features of a cryptocurrency, it took me a while to truly grasp what it was and what role it played in a functioning cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the 30 minutes provided I hope to demystify what a Blockchain is and break down the core features of a Blockchain by walking the audience through one created in JavaScript (being a JavaScript enthusiast and all..)."

Depending on your knowledge of IT and how to be secure this can be a really scary place.\n\nFor this talk I’m going to take you to the other side of this problem. How do we build software to empower users to be more secure? Working on the UX team we strive to help our users know exactly what is happening and where they’re being attacked. To do this we need to filter out a huge amount of noise and help them pinpoint the exact moment of attack, and even better what they need to do next."

All the latest cloud services put incredible power at the finger-tips of the developer, but with great abstraction comes great responsibility! \nLet's describe the Serverless concept, how AWS uses it to plug powerful services together. Then dive into the challenges with working in this way - performance, monitoring, cost, reliability, security..etc... Then jump into the Customer interaction, you can release really quickly, so there's a different way of working.

In essence, multiple applications need to be integrated to enable data flow.\n\nHowever, what happens if one of these systems is out of support or needs to be replaced?

It initially gained popularity on Android but has since spread to all kinds of application development. Although originally a JVM based language compilers have now been released that target JavaScript and native code.\n\nArrow is a functional coding library, aimed at developers who love Kotlin but also want to use frameworks previously only available in languages like F#, Haskell and Scala. Its most fundamental feature is provision for Typeclasses. On top of this are built implementations of standard FP monadic datatypes (Try, Option, State etc...), types for managing effects (IO, Async etc...), support for Optics and integrations with other frameworks like RxJava.\n\nThis talk will introduce, via copious examples, the more functional style of Kotlin development possible with Arrow and discuss its merits in typical industry scenarios.

I'd like to do my 'I've levelled up a wee bit' talk - which is about the NI Game Dev scene in Northern Ireland and the tools that we use, for those who may not even know such a scene exists. \n\nThe talk will roughly cover the following:\n\nThe Job of a Games Developer, Training & Skills Needed, What Do Games Companies Look For, What Development Software is Useful, Journey to Whitepot, The NI Games Development Industry."

What can you learn? Well my aim is the answer both in this short dive into creating JS libraries and publishing them.\n\nI’ll cover everything you need to create them, covering common build tools, useful libraries, writing solid tests and docs along with how to version them properly and publish them to NPM.\n\n---\n\nChloe's talk is \"Worst case scenario they say no!\":\n\nI have recently realised the importance of taking as many opportunities as possible especially as a student. In the tech industry there are so many different ways to get involved in the local community, such as going to hackathons, meet ups or even conferences. All of these are great for finding other people in similar situations to yourself or finding people to learn from. Throughout my talk I want to explain why this is so important and my experiences in getting involved.\n\n---\n\nDavid's talk is \"Oh FOSS It - Free helpers through open source\":\n\nIn 2008 I replaced a bunch of disconnected ageing scripts that monitored my servers with a single simple network monitor... and released it open source in case anyone (or two) might use it. Over the next ten years it grew thanks to free community involvement both in terms of testing, suggestions, code submissions, community support, and everything else. Along the way it's spawned two independent FOSS projects which are spun-off components of the monitor which have their own lives now.\n\nThis talk will be a brief journey through this story and the lessons I've learnt that encourage me to release everything I can as FOSS - mainly to help me build the product if for no other reason!"

I’ll give a whirlwind high-level tour of each and also show examples of the related projects I’ve spend my time on in recent months, including hand-crafted artisanal music scrobbling."

For many, it's just stand-ups and sprints, and nothing else has changed. In fact, it's probably worse, because Agile promises to be so much, and when it's not done properly, leaves real disappointment and resentment; it feels like the Emperor's new clothes. It just doesn't feel very SAFe.\n\nModern Agile attempts to address this by putting safety at the core of its being: the safety to experiment, the safety to fail, the safety to learn. This is more important for building awesome products, services and solutions than anything else, and unlocks true potential.\n\nI'm going to talk about management theory, about motivation, about safety, and about how Modern Agile principles should be at the core of doing things well."

During his ten years in the Air Force, Paul has acted as a B-52 Navigator, Flight Operations scheduler, Radar Navigator, and Director of Current Operations for Minot Air Force Base.  Working in the field of operations with the Air Force has given Paul the appreciation and capability of making high quality, fast-paced, critical decisions in high pressure situations.  After leaving the Air Force, he used his prolific experience in leadership and Computer Science to build and lead software development teams. Paul has over nine years of experience with managing 24x7 operations for SaaS solutions. Additionally, he joined Bazaarvoice in 2014, quickly becoming a leader in R&D assisting and kick-starting its transformation into a lean and agile organization.\n\n\"I firmly believe that quality is the #1 thing when building software.  Ultimately, if you sacrifice quality in order to finish a product sooner the cost to the client, consumer, and company is greater than anyone anticipates.  In the past 3.5 years in which I have been with Bazaarvoice, my teams have delivered a tremendous amount of value with a 'quality-first' mentality and I look forward to bringing similar success into building the Bazaarvoice Belfast Office and R&D team.\""
